# activateMe (Back-End Capstone)

## Description
activateMe is a caloirie counting app that allows users to log plant based foods and exercises in order to earn points and badges. I built this app because I wanted users to eat more plant based foods. Upon login, the user will be redirected to their dashboard where they;ll be able to see their personal information, links to other features of the app, and a view of all their current badges.
